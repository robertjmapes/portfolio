      <h2>2D Vector Field Modelling in Pygame</h2>
      <h5>April 4, 2021</h5>
      <h5>
        In this application a number of points spawn in a predefined state, and are acted on by a vector field to produce some fascinating dynamics.

        Newtonian gravity is very hard to organically simulate, in my previous simulations I set out to compute the equations of motion by finding the sum of the acceleration vectors and the sum of the sum of the angular velocity vectors for each body, but I was unable to do the latter. Which caused the bodies to only exhibit parabolic and hyperbolic behaviour but not elliptical. Previously I had tried setting the equations of motion before hand and not had to deal with the vector computation, but although ellipitcal behaviour was exhibited it lacked the organic feeling of the computer finding the equations of motion. 
      </p>
      <p>
        So instead I turned to vector fields, and made a small application which models the motion of particles by a vector field. Although this is not what I set out to originally do - which was simulate Newtonian gravity with only the masses and distances of each object - it is facinating and produces amazing behaviour, a refreshing way to view vector fields.

      Each point is an object, a very simple object with just a draw function and a varaible for its position vector, radius and color.
      <pre><code>class Body:
    def __init__(self, x, y, color, R):
        self.r = np.array([x, y], dtype=float)
        self.color, self.R = color, R
    def draw(self, window):
        pg.draw.circle(window, self.color, self.r, self.R)</code></pre>

      Then I made a for loop which adds an object to an array each iteration. Here the initial position can also be configured,
      <pre><code>BORDER = 200
for i in range(BORDER, HEIGHT-BORDER, 5):
    for j in range(BORDER, HEIGHT-BORDER, 5):
        objects.append(Body(i, j, WHITE, 1))</code></pre>

      Then to update the position of each point I just iterate through the array and apply its equations of motion.
      <pre><code>for i in objects:
    i.color = BLUE
    i.r += F(i.r[0], i.r[1])</code></pre>

      Thats it! Well of course it not much, its just simply applying a function in both x and y to a large set of particles. The code is linked <a href="https://pastebin.com/1T5NaWVq">here</a>
